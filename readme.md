# Game Launcher


A game launcher based on electron.js. It can update itself and the game files by using [versionAPI](https://github.com/gkravas/versionAPI). Updating procedure for both game and electron.js laucher are custom written. They have been tested to Windows and OS X. Probably works on linux distributions too. UI is using placeholders for text.
